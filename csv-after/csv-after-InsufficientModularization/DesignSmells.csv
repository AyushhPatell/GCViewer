Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell,
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestDataReaderUJLShenandoah,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods,
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestDataReaderSun1_8_0,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 28 public methods,
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestDataReaderSun1_6_0,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 54 public methods,
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestAbstractDataReaderSun.AbstractDataReaderSunSub,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestAbstractDataReaderSun.AbstractDataReaderSunSub,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.),
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestDataReaderSun1_7_0G1,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 30 public methods,
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestDataReaderSun1_6_0G1,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 24 public methods,
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestDataReaderFactory,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: name,
imp,com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp,TestDataReaderFactory,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 34 public methods,
